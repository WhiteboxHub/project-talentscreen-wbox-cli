# JobCLI Architecture Overview

JobCLI is a high-fidelity, automated job application engine. It uses a hybrid approach — a natively injected Chrome Extension (TalentScreen) handles DOM autofill, while a Python orchestration layer driven by Playwright and LLMs covers discovery, fallback filling, and session management.

## 1. High-Level System Architecture

The system is split into five distinct layers. Each layer has a single responsibility and communicates downward through clean interfaces.

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **CLI Layer** | User-facing commands (`run`, `setup`, `sync`) and interactive onboarding TUI |
| **Orchestration Layer** | Job lifecycle management — discovery, looping, retry, status tracking |
| **Automation & Extension** | Stealth browser launch, Chrome extension mounting, DOM interaction |
| **Intelligence & LLM** | Custom question answering, synonym-based field matching, resume tailoring |
| **Storage & Data** | SQLite persistence, Pydantic-validated resume/profile schemas |

## 2. Application Execution Flow

When a user runs `jobcli run`, the system follows this end-to-end sequence:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **CLI receives `jobcli run`** → instantiates `ApplicationEngine` with the user's config.
2. **Engine launches Chromium** in Stealth mode using Playwright persistent context with anti-detection flags.
3. **Extension is mounted** → `extension/helpers.py` resolves `~/.jobcli/extension_unpacked` (or overrides) and passes it via `--load-extension` to Chrome.
4. **Job Discovery** → `wbox_discoverer.py` logs into Whitebox Learning, scrapes job listings from the dashboard.
5. **Per-Job Loop** → For each job URL, the engine navigates, waits for the ATS form to stabilize, then:
   - Calls `window.AutofillExtension.injectProfile` / `configure` / `fill` via Playwright (`autofill_bridge.py`)
   - The extension's content scripts parse each ATS (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.) using its registered strategy
6. **LLM Fallback** → If any field is left unfilled (custom essay questions, unusual dropdowns), the engine sends the field label + resume context to the configured LLM provider for a tailored answer.
7. **Submit** → A human-simulated click submits the form; the engine records the outcome in SQLite.

## 4. Extension Integration Deep Dive

The Chrome Extension is the critical autofill engine. Here's how it integrates:

```
jobcli package
    └── src/jobcli/assets/talentscreen_extension/  (bundled at build time)

jobcli setup
    └── extension/install.py: install_bundled_extension(force=True)
            └── → ~/.jobcli/extension_unpacked/

jobcli apply / resolve
    └── extension/helpers.py: resolve_extension_dir()
            ├── JOBCLI_EXTENSION_PATH
            ├── config.extension_path
            ├── ~/.jobcli/extension_unpacked
            ├── auto-install bundled → ~/.jobcli/extension_unpacked
            ├── bin/project-talentscreen-autofill-extension  (legacy)
            └── sibling project-talentscreen-autofill-extension

ApplicationEngine.start_session()
    │
    └── Playwright launch_persistent_context(
              args=["--load-extension=<resolved_path>"]
        )
            └── pageWorldBridge.js → window.AutofillExtension (__bridge)
                    └── autofill_bridge.run_extension_autofill()
```

## 5. Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Bundled extension in package** | No separate TalentScreen git clone required; `jobcli setup` installs to `~/.jobcli/extension_unpacked` |
| **Persistent browser context** | Retains cookies/session between job applications — no repeated logins |
| **Stealth Playwright flags** | Bypasses Cloudflare, DataDome, and ATS bot-detection fingerprinting |
| **LLM as fallback only** | Keeps cost low; extension handles 90%+ of standard fields natively |
| **SQLite for state** | Zero-dependency, portable persistence that works offline and on shared machines |
| **Empty `__init__.py` files** | Forces explicit imports, prevents circular dependencies, improves startup time |
